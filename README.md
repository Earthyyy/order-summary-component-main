## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used for the first time `background-size` property, It was a little bit annoying at the beginning, but didn't take me a long time to adapt to it.



### Difficulties

I had a hard time figuring out the appropriate box shadow for the order card and purchase button. I'm still not familiar with using this CSS property.
